Chatbot without RAG!!!
Create a streamlit app that lets you chat with any type of media file (documents, images, videos, audio).
All this without doing any RAG!
That's because we are using Gemini 1.5 family of models, which give us a context window of 1MM tokens.  That's 1 hour of video, over 700K words, 11 hours of audio, etc.
Enjoy!  Please "Star" this repo if you find my code helpful and useful, much appreciated!
